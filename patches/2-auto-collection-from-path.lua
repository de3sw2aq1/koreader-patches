-- Automatically fake-add books to collections based on first path component (folder name)
-- 
-- e.g. put /mnt/onboard/foo/bar/baz.epub into collection "foo" if home_dir is /mnt/onboard/
--
-- Doesn't actually add books to collections, but patches ReadCollection:isFileInCollection() to lie and and says they're in one.
-- ReadCollection:isFileInCollections() has not been patched, otherwise it may return true for all books. This way â˜† won't show for all books, only manual collections.
-- This seems to be good enough for History filtering by category.
-- Collection name is the first path component (relative to home_dir).
-- Collections are automatically created on startup, to populate the collections list for filtering.
